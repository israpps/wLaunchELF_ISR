_this uLaunchELF mod was my first PS2 project._

It features:

- Timestamp manipulation feature to fix the date of any memory card folder containing any icon-based exploit _(\*tuna)_
- Extra file extensions for Text Editor ShortCuts
- ~`100kb` smaller that it´s original counterpart (wLE 41e4ebe) (this was possible thanks to CI with ps2dev:v1.0 toolchain)
- Support for PS3/PS4 Dualshocks thanks to Alex Parrado
#### this mod has proven to be excellent for HDD, USB and MC management.

> this mod is already bundled on any mod/project/repack made by me (and it´s auto-updated if that project is hosted here on github)
